# Three-phase modeling
This repository provides MATLAB scripts that construct the bus admittance matrix for the following three-phase distribution networks
* IEEE 37-bus feeder
* IEEE 123-bus feeder
* 8500-node feeder
* European 906-bus low voltage feeder (ELV 906-bus feeder)

The data files for the aforementioned feeders are downloaded from https://ewh.ieee.org/soc/pes/dsacom/testfeeders/.
Benchmark solutions  for the IEEE 37-bus feeder and the ELV 906-bus feeder  are taken from the EPRI distribution system simulator,  [OpenDSS](https://sourceforge.net/projects/electricdss/). 
Benchmark solutions for the IEEE 123-bus and the 8500-node feeder are taken from https://ewh.ieee.org/soc/pes/dsacom/testfeeders/.
