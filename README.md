# three-phase-modeling
This repository provides MATLAB scripts that construct the bus admittance matrix for the following three-phase distribution systems:
1) IEEE 37-bus feeder
2) IEEE 123-bus feeder
3) 8500-node feeder
4) European 906-bus low voltage feeder (ELV 906-bus feeder)

The data files for the aforementioned feeders are taken from the following website:
https://ewh.ieee.org/soc/pes/dsacom/testfeeders/

Benchmark solutions  for the IEEE 37-bus feeder and the ELV 906-bus feeder  are taken from the EPRI distribution system simulator,  OpenDSS (available online at https://sourceforge.net/projects/electricdss/). 
Benchmark solutions for the IEEE 123-bus and the 8500-node feeder are taken from https://ewh.ieee.org/soc/pes/dsacom/testfeeders/.
